We noticed that more and more disparity metrics have appeared during the last decade, but most of them are based on the same group specific metrics. Hence, such a separation of group specific and disparity metrics computation allows us to experiment with different combinations of group specific metrics and avoid group metrics recomputation for a new set of disparity metrics."
